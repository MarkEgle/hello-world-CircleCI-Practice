# hello-world-CircleCI-Practice
I am new to this game but plan am happy to be in a space that forces me to learn something that I may lack the self-discipline to learn on my own. 

I have been wanting to learn how to code, and now have a reason to learn.

I want to see what it is like to be a software engineer, so I can see what problems they are facing. This will most definitely make me a better salesperson.
